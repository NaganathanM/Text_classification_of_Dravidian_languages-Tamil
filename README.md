# Text_classification_of_Dravidian_languages(Tamil)
India, being a diverse nation, has many regional languages and dialects. There are 22 official languages in India. In this age of information, processing these natural language data is challenging. Further, the Indian regional languages are low resourced when compared to other languages such as English or other European languages. These regional languages have their own unique letters, language structure and signs. It is relatively less complex to deal with the data in English through standard ASCII codes than regional languages. Building the machines’ abilities of understanding regional languages is strenuous and is done utilizing different methods. Tamil language is one of the morphologically rich, Dravidian languages. Tamil is an official language of the state of Tamil Nadu in India and in the sovereign nations of Sri Lanka and Singapore. A humble attempt to utilize Naïve Bayes classifier, to classify Tamil text among English. A data set was created with a mix of English and Tamil text and the model was trained to classify the text as one of the two classes of the languages. Since the data collection part was tedious to make it fir for the project, text from other languages were not used for the sake of reducing unnecessary complexity. Having said that, the methodologies followed are essentially useful to be applied for other languages of the Dravidian family provided the right data resources are available.
